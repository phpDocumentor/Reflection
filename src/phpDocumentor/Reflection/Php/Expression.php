/**
 * Represents an expression with a define statement, constant, property, enum case and any other location.
 *
 * Certain expressions contain useful references to other elements or types. Examples of these are:
 *
 * - Define statements that use an expression to refer to a class or function
 * - Properties whose default value refers to a constant
 * - Arguments whose default value initialize an object
 * - Enum Cases that refer to a function or constant
 *
 * This class represents every location where an expression is used and contains 2 pieces of information:
 *
 * - The expression string containing placeholders linking to useful information
 * - An array of 'parts' whose keys equal the placeholders in the expression string and whose values is the extracted
 *   information, such as an {@see FQSEN} or {@see Type}.
 *
 * In a way, the expression string is similar in nature to a URI Template (see links) where you have a string containing
 * variables that can be replaced. These variables are delimited by `{{` and `}}`, and are build up of the prefix PHPDOC
 * and then an MD5 hash of the name of the extracted information.
 *
 * It is not necessary for a consumer to interpret the information when they do not need it, a {@see self::__toString()}
 * magic method is provided that will replace the placeholders with the `toString()` output of each part.
 *
 * @link https://github.com/php/php-langspec/blob/master/spec/10-expressions.md
 *     for the definition of expressions in PHP.
 * @link https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6570 for more information on URI Templates.
 * @see ExpressionPrinter how an expression coming from PHP-Parser is transformed into an expression.
